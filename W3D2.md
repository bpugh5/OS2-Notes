* Semphores
    * They maintain a count
    
    * Operations:
        * Wait
        * Post, Signal

    * If you wait:
        * If the count > 0:
            * Decrement the count
            * Keep on running
        * else
            * Sleep
    
    * If you signal/post:
        * Increment the semaphore count
            * This wakes up waiting threads
        * Keep on running

* Use Cases

    * Can be like a mutex

        * Set the semaphore count to 1
        * A "wait" acts like "lock"
        * "signal" acts like "unlock"

    * Force the order of threads 

        * Set semaphore count to 0
        * Have the thread to go 2nd wait on the semaphore
        * Let the thread to go 1st run...
        * Then first thread can signal when ready

    * Allowing n threads to do a thing at once
        * Set the semaphore count to n

        * Set count to 10
        
        * Run producer
            * Loop
                * Wait
                * Add item to queue

        * Run consumer
            * Loop
                * Remove item from queue
                * Post
        
        # Wake up consumer & check if list is empty, if is, return

* Deadlock
    * If thread A is holding a mutex, waiting for thread B to release mutex that's holding a mutex waiting
    for thread A to release mutex.
