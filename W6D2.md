* Parity Bits

    * Counting the number of `1` bits in a byte
        
        * If it's odd, the parity is `1`
        * If it's even, the parity is `0`

        `01011101`: parity: 1
        `01010101`: parity: 0
        
        ```
        100001011   Always even once we attach the parity bit
        101110110   
        101100111
        001101100
        ```

        Richard Hamming has a bunch of books on this, heavy reading.

* A bit of RAID

_Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks_

* Data redundancy
* Speed/Throughput

* RAID Levels
    
    * Raid 0 - Striping
    * Raid 1 - Mirror
    * Raid 4
    * Raid 5


* Quick bit about XOR

    * If you XOR a number with any other number twice, you get original number

    * You can compute parity with it:

        ```
            10100010 Disk A
        XOR 11110111 Disk B
        ------------
            01010101 Parity
        ```

        ```
            10100010 Disk A
        XOR 01010101 Parity
        ------------
            11110111 We got Disk B back!
        ```

        Look up: "XOR swap", swap two integers using XOR

* Group work: pore over the project
    * Look at Project 6
    * Come up with 4-5 questions about the project
    * 15 minutes
    * Choose the hardest question
    * Try to answer it
    * 5 minutes

    * What exactly is an in-core inode and what is its purpose and how does it differ from the inodes stored in blocks 3-6
    * Why for iput are we only writing to disk if the refcount was decremented?
    * What changed from our conversation about the name field in the inode?
    * What is the estimated average overall time that it should take a student for this project


* Hack time
