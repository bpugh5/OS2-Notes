* namei Algorithm
    * Turn a filename at the end of a path into its inode 
    number

    * "/foo/bar/baz.txt"   <-- what's the inode of baz.txt

    ```
    / root (inode #0):
    0 .
    0 ..
    1 foo
    
    /foo (inode #1):
    1 .
    0 ..
    2 bar [directory]

    /foo/bar (inode #2):
    2 .
    1 ..
    3 baz.txt   [regular file]

    namei input: /foo/bar/baz.txt
    namei output: 3
    ```
* Making directories

    ```
    directory_make("/foo");
    ```

    What are the steps?

    * Parse the directory entry
        * Split the new directory name from the rest of the path
        * If we had a real namei, we'd look up the inode number of the path to the file.
        * Our stubbed namei will return the inode number of root.
    * Make sure the directory name isn't already in this directory [Not necessary for the project]
    * Allocate new inode for "foo" (ialloc())
    * Allocate new data block for foo's entries (alloc())
    * In the existing directory, store the new directory's inode number and name
    * `.` and `..` added to the new directory
    * Write it all back to disk (bwrite(), iput())

* Checksums

    * Error detection mechanism

    * Feed data into a black box, and the box produces a fixed-length number representing that data.

    * If I give you the data and the checksum
    * You recompute the checksum from the data using the same algorithm
    * You make sure the checksums match

    * Related to hashes: MD5, SHA1, SHA256

    * Common checksum: Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC, CRC-32)

    * Collision: when two files have the same checksum

    * Simple algorithm: (sum of numbers) mod 10

      1 2 3

      (1+2+3)%10 == 6
      
      I send: 1 2 3, 6

      You receive: 1 2 3, 6
                   2 1 3, 6
