* Prodev!

* Project 7
* Directories

    * Purpose: map a filename to its inode number

    * Directories are files--just a special type of file.

        * They have an inode

        * The data associated with the directory is a bunch of
        _directory entries_.

            * This data is stored in regular data blocks
    
    * Directory entry:
        
        * 2 bytes: inode number
        * 16 bytes: file name
        * 14 bytes: reserved

    * `size` of the Directory (in its inode)

        * Number of entries * size of each entry

* The root directory

    * Special in that it's created automatically--by `mkfs()`!

    * Will have inode #0.

        * Normally the root inode number would be stored in the
        superblock!
    
    * There are two directory entries in every directory:

        * `.` `..`

        * The current directory, parent directory
    
    * What do the first two directory entries for the root directory 
    contain?

    inode   file name
    -----   ---------
      0         .
      0         ..
      1         foo.txt
      1         bar.txt                 "hard link"
      2         baz.txt ->  foo.txt     "symbolic link"

    create /foo.txt
    open /foo.txt

    open ./foo.txt
    open /home/beej/files/./foo.txt

* Group discussion: what needs to happen in order to create the root 
  directory

    * What needs to be called/allocated/written to/etc.?

    1. Get the inode for the directory (`ialloc()`)
    2. Get a block to hold the directory entries (`alloc()`)
    2a. Other metadata:
        * `size`: set to 64 (2 * 32)
        * `link_count`: 1
        * `flags`: 2 (directory type)
        * 
    3. Write the block number to the inode`block_ptr` array
        Have the inode point to the data block
    4. In the block, set up the `.` `..` entries.
        * Assign current and parent to point to root
    5. `iput()` the root in-core inode, writes to disk
    6. `bwrite()` the data block with the directory entries
