# CS 444 OS2

* About the Project
* Concurrency Bugs

    * Non-deadlock bugs
        * Atomicity violations
            * This is when we have multiple instructions that we expect to execute together;
            they won't be interrupted in between.

            ```
            lock() <T2> 
            if x > 0:<T3>
                x--;
            unlock()
                <T1>
            ```

        * Order Violations
            '''
            global data
            global sem(0)

            thread_1_run() {
                read(x)     # read data from somewhere
                data = x
                sem_post(sem)
            }

            thread_2_run() {
                sem_wait(sem) 
                print(data) <T2>
            }

            create(thread_1_run)
            create(thread_2_run)
            ```
    
    * Deadlock bugs

        ```
        f1():
            lock(m1)
            <T1>
            lock(m2)

            # do work on 2 data structures

            unlock(m1)
            unlock(m2)
        f2():
            lock(m1)
            lock(m2)

            # do other work on 2 data structures

            unlock (m2)
            unlock (m1)

        f3():
        lock(m2)
        
        # do work

        unlock(m2)
        ```

        * 4 components of deadlock
            * Mutual Exclusion
                * When you hold a lock, someone else can't get to that code
            * Hold-and-wait
                * When you hold one resource, and you're waiting for another
            * No preemption
                * You can't interrupt a waiting thread
            * Circular wait
                * Dining Philosophers, everyone has left fork
