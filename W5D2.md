* Device I/O Methods

    * How can a program (like OS) talk to hardware

        * Ports

            * 'IN' 'OUT'

        * Memory Mapping

    * I/O Methods

        * Programmed I/O -- the CPU does all the work.

        * Interrupts
            * CPU says "do this work and tell me when you're done"
            * When the hardware is done, the CPU copies the data into memory from the hardware.
        
        * DMA Direct Memory Access -- Hardware can access some memory directly

* Hack time
