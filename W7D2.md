* Journaling!
* How it works

    * Let's write in the "journal" what we're about to do.

    * Then let's do those things.

    * Then let's remove the entry from the journal.

    Example: create a file

    * Create a journal entryr:

        * Get an inode for the file
        * Add a directory entry for the file
        * Save the inode and directory entry
        
    * _Checkpoint_ the journal

    Do all the things in this journal entry

    * Remove the journal entry

    * The journal entry:
    
    ```
    |Transaction start|Action|Action|...|Transaction end|
    ```

    What happens when the power goes out:

    * Partway through the journal write (reset to the last successful transaction) (treat it like it never happened)
    * Between the journal write and the disk write (reset to the start of the journal) 
    * Partway through the disk write (reset to the start of the journal, do it all again)
    * Between the disk write and removing the journal entry (reset to the start of the journal)
    * Partway through removing the journal entry (restart from the journal write)

    How do you recover?

    * Metadata-only journaling

    ```
    Write Block to disk
    |Ts|Alloc|Update inode|Te|
    ```

    Faster!

    * Brain primer: directories

    Directories are files that map file names to inodes.

    They have a bunch of "entries" that do this on a per-file basis.

* Group brainstorm: more project questions!
    * what's the difference between accessing struct data with a typical struct vs a struct pointer (arrow or dot?)
    * how should we test iget(), there's no "TEST" message below the section like everything else
    * what's the difference between just opening a file and opening with a file descriptor
