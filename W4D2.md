* Event-based concurrency

    * One big loop that consumes events
    ```
    while (true):
        ev = get_next_event();
        ev.handle();
    ```
    * Other parts of the program produce events
        * Events are produced in other event handlers

* Benefits
* Drawbacks
* That's it for the easy(er) week!
