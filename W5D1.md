# CS 444 OS2

* File systems
    * What is it?
    * Data stored in "blocks" on disk, usually 4 KB

    * File System components
        * _metadata_ about files
            * Include file name, size, etc.
            * Includes pointers to the data blocks
        * The Superblock is metadata about the file system

    * Free Block Map
        * Keeps track of which blocks are free/used.
        * Free list, basically a linked list of free blocks.
        * Bitmap.

                             ^ (free)
            ```

            ```
                0        1        2
            01010101 01010101 10110101 ...

            find byte & bit by integer division & modulo
            ```
        
        * _inodes_: where metadata is stored
            
            * Effectively a big array of inodes on disk
                * Spread over some number of contiguous blocks
                    * In our case, 4 blocks.
            
            * Fixed size: 64 bytes

        * Which inodes are free?

            * Use a bitmap.
    * The file system so far:
        * Block 0: Superblock
            * Number of inode data blocks, for instance
        * Block 1: free inode map
        * Block 2: free block map
        * Block 3: inode data block 0
        * Block 4: inode data block 1
        * Block 5: inode data block 2
        * Block 6: inode data block 3
        * Block 7-end: user file data

* Project 5 onward

    * Make and the Makefile

        * Build all the non-main C files into a library
            * First: build them all to object files

                * Compiled (into machine code) but not linked
                    (but not an executable)

            * Second: bundle the object files into a library

                * Just a collection of .o, effectively
        
        * Build the main C file into an object file

        * Build the main object file and library together into an executable
