* Intro
* Goals
  * Concurrency
  * File systems and data storage

* Concurrency
  * Making things work correctly with shared resources & multiple programs are using it.

* Threads
  * Sometimes referred to as 'lightweight processes'
  * A process can spawn many threads
  * Threads share global data
    * (But not locals!)

  * Main uses of threads:
    * Parallelism!
    * Avoid blocking on I/O

  * Thread operations
    * Create
      * `pthread_create()`
      
      ```
      void *run(void *arg)
      {
        char *string_to_print = arg;

        // run thread stuff!
        printf("%s\n", string_to_print) // or u can cast it with (char *)
        
        return NULL;
      }

      // char x[9] = "hi there";
      char *x = "hi there";
    
      int main(void)
      {
      // pthread_t = pthread type, receives pthread identifier
      pthread_t t1, t2;
      int x = 12;

      pthread_create(&t1, NULL, run, ("hi there!" || &x));
      pthread_create(&t2, NULL, run, x);
      // run here is a pointer to the function, not an actual call

      a[2] = 34;
      *(a+2) = 34;
      }
      ```

    * Join -- wait for a thread to finish
      * `pthread_join()`
    * Kill
      * `pthread_kill()`
