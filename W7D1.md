* A tiny bit about directories

    * Maps file names to inode numbers

    * In a directory entry:
        
        1. a filename
        2. an inode number

    * Every directory has two files to start: `.` `..`

    Root directory: `/`

      filename  inode number
      --------  ------------
         .           0
         ..          0
         foo         1376       (this is a subdirectory)

    Subdirectory: `/foo`, inode 1376

    filename  inode number
    --------  ------------
        .           1376
        ..          0
        bar         1247

cd /foo/../foo/../foo
        
* What can go wrong during a crash?

    * Imagine we're creating a new file.

        1. What are all the steps in creating a new file?

            * Which blocks are touched?
                * Free inode block (1)
                * inode data block (inode record for this file) (3-7)
                * inode data block (inode record for the directory) 
                * Free map block (2)
                    If the directory overflows
                    If we were writing to the new file
                * The block containing the directory entry (8-1024)
        
        1b. What happens in sequence?   ^^^

            1. Get a free inode for the new file
                * Access the free inode block
                * Find a free inode, mark it as non-free
                * Access the inode data block to put the new data in there
            2. Find the inode for the directory the new file will go in
            3. Check if the directory block is full, if so:
                
                3a. Get a new free block
                3b. Update the directory inode (new block ptr, new size)
            
            4. Add to the directory


        2. What can go wrong if the process is interrupted at any of these steps?

            Crash after 3a, block is marked as used, but it is not actually used. "Phantom memory use"

            Same in 1b, but reverse steps 1b and 1c to prevent inconsistency

            Some kind of file system checker that looks for blocks that have no inode entries, and the opposite.

            * `fsck` does this.
            * Power outage, computer freezes.
            
                * Inode thinks its pointing to a file, but file was never written (garbage data)

* A small Journaling primer

    1. We're going to write to disk what we're about to store on disk.
    2. We're going to write to disk the data we want to write.
    3. We're going to delete the stuff from step 1.
